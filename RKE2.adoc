## Installing on SLEMicro

.RKE2 installation places kubectl in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/
* Can't create symlinks into /usr/
* Best just to add it to the root user's path (along with /opt/rke2/bin for the uninstall and kill scripts):
----
echo "export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml" >> ~/.bashrc 
echo "PATH=${PATH}:/opt/rke2/bin:/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/" >> ~/.bashrc && source  ~/.bashrc
----

.Installation options: https://docs.rke2.io/install/install_options/install_options/

.Releases page: https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases

.Supported RKE2 versions for running Rancher: https://rancher.com/support-maintenance-terms/all-supported-versions/

* Take note of the syntax of the RKE version, i.e. "vX.YY.Z+rke2r1"

* Install a single node: 
----
curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION="v1.20.6+rke2r1" sh -
----

* On MicroOS, the following gets installed into /opt/rke2/bin:
** rke2  
** rke2-killall.sh  
** rke2-uninstall.sh

.There doesn't seem to be a reference for the config.yaml file
* Just says "The configuration file parameters map directly to CLI arguments, with repeatable CLI arguments being represented as YAML lists.
* I.e.
----
rke2 server \
  --write-kubeconfig-mode "0644"    \
  --tls-san "foo.local"             \
  --node-label "foo=bar"            \
  --node-label "something=amazing"
----
* Is the same as:
----
write-kubeconfig-mode: "0644"
tls-san:
  - "foo.local"
node-label:
  - "foo=bar"
  - "something=amazing"
----
* Not sure if some parameters are required to be lists, such as tls-san (but it seems like that's the case)
* References for command line options (and config.yaml file equivelents at the end of each line): 
** All server installation parameters are at: https://docs.rke2.io/install/install_options/server_config/
** All agent installation parameters are at: https://docs.rke2.io/install/install_options/agent_config/

.Seems like the order of installation is:
1. Download the script with the appropriate version
2. Update the /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml file
3. systemctl enable --now rke2-server.service
* export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml


## Troubleshooting:

* Uses the same containerd CRI socket as K3s: 
`crictl --runtime-endpoint /run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock ps`
