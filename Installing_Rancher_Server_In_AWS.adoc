## Setting up the VPC and supporting resources
* Depending on the options chosen for the deployment, you may need the AWS API access key and secret key for the AWS account used for the deployment
* Deploy three instances based on the following considerations:
** Identify the required instancy type according to CPU and RAM capacity guidance in the "RKE Install Requirements" tab of https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/#hardware-requirements
** The Rancher server must be accessible from the Internet, thus the VPC to be used must have a configured Internet Gateway and all RKE nodes must have a publicly routable IP address
** SLES nodes need to be an instance type of t2.medium or larger to get built-in subscriptions
*** Completing this deployment without a SLES subscription has not yet been attempted
** For the SLES registation process to complete correctly, attach a public IP address to the primary NIC when creating the instances
*** After the nodes are booted up and ready, remove the public IP adresses, then allocate and attach Elastic IP addresses to them
* Create two IAM policies for the control-plane RKE role and another for both etcd and worker RKE roles: https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/cloud-providers/aws/#iam-requirements
* (Optional) Create an IAM policy to allow the RKE nodes to store etcd snapshots in S3: https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/etcd-snapshots/recurring-snapshots/

NOTE: This design maintains all three RKE roles (control-plane, etcd, and worker) on all three RKE node 

* Create one IAM role and attach the policies to it 
** If splitting out RKE roles to different nodes is desired, i.e. creating a separate etcd cluster; it is more secure to create additional IAM roles that serve only the required RKE roles
* Attach the IAM role to the nodes
* Tag the resources: https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/cloud-providers/aws/#tagging-aws-resources
** Tag the VPC, subnet, and security group as "shared"
* Create a Security Group based on: https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/requirements/ports/
** Alternately, can deploy a docker container Rancher server, enter the API credentials and deploy a single node RKE cluster in EC2
*** Can later destroy the RKE cluster and the node with the Rancher server, but preserve the Security Group

* Create an NLB: https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/resources/advanced/helm2/create-nodes-lb/nlb/

## Prepare the nodes
* All nodes must have sshd_config configured with “AllowTcpForwarding yes”
** Restart sshd after making the change
* Make sure the primary user account on the nodes (which will be specified in the cluster.yml file) is in the docker group
* The ssh key from the user and node that will run "rke up" need to be in the authorized_keys file

## Create and configure the RKE cluster.yml file:

* Fairly simple overview of creating the cluster: https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/resources/k8s-tutorials/ha-rke/
* Basic cluster.yaml file. Useful to show how to turn on basic etcd snapshots: https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/resources/advanced/helm2/kubernetes-rke/
** Better to run `rke config` and go through the steps
*** Later have to add the NLB URL to network.authentication.sans: [rancher.mycompany.com] to have it included in the Let's Encrypt certificate
**** After "rke up", set the clusters.cluster.server in the kube_config_cluster.yml file to the same name to access the K8s API through the NLP
*** Note: Setting the "cloud_provider.name" field to AWS suppressed the K8s hostnames (hostname_override in the cluster.yml file) and inserted the AWS hostnames

** Used Let's Encrypt and it works well
