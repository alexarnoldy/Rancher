## K3AI
* Command line tool that takes in a specification and deploys a K8s cluster
* Further invocations can add AI frameworks and tools to the deployed cluster
** Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and limited ARM support
** Not sure if it can just deploy AI to existing cluster
** Not sure if you can deploy the cluster and specific AI tools at the same time
** As of 01/2021 can deploy:
*** Rancher K3s to pre-provisioned nodes
*** Rancher K3d to a docker enabled host
*** Mirantis K0s (have no idea how it works)
*** KinD to a docker enabled host
*** A "remote" cluster

## K3s
* Server install command that sets the permissions correctly for the KUBECONFIG file: `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE=644 sh -s -`
* Agent install command (K3S_URL sets the node to worker mode): `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<FQDN of server>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<token> sh -`
** The token is found on the Agent node in `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token`
** Likely need to provide LB address for the FQDN of the server for HA
