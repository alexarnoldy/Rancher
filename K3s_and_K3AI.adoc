## K3AI
* Command line tool that takes in a specification and deploys a K8s cluster
* Further invocations can add AI frameworks and tools to the deployed cluster
** Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and limited ARM support
** Not sure if it can just deploy AI to existing cluster
** Not sure if you can deploy the cluster and specific AI tools at the same time
** As of 01/2021 can deploy:
*** Rancher K3s to pre-provisioned nodes
*** Rancher K3d to a docker enabled host
*** Mirantis K0s (have no idea how it works)
*** KinD to a docker enabled host
*** A "remote" cluster

## K3s
* Server install command that sets the permissions correctly for the KUBECONFIG file: `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE=644 sh -s -`
* Agent install command (K3S_URL sets the node to worker mode): `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<FQDN of server>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<token> sh -`
** The token is found on the Agent node in `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token`
** Likely need to provide LB address for the FQDN of the server for HA

.k3sup
* Had tons of trouble creating a cluster manually. K3sup worked well

.Create the custer with the first server(master) node:
----
k3sup install --ip=10.110.2.0 --tls-san=10.110.2.10 --cluster --k3s-channel=stable --merge --local-path=$HOME/.kube/config --context=ha-k3ai
----
* Equals signs are optional
* --ip is the server to be installed
* --tls-san ensures the VIP (currently presented by keepalived) is included in the TLS cert
* --cluster tells the first server node set etcd up in cluster mode
* --merge merges the new cluster context (ha-k3ai in this case) with the existing one in ~/.kube/config
** Note that the KUBECONFIG file won't materialize if there is no file at that location or it can't be parsed correctly
.Adding the each additional server(master) node:
----
k3sup join --ip 10.110.2.1 --server --server-ip 10.110.2.10 --k3s-channel stable
----
* --ip is the server to be installed
* --server-ip is the VIP for the K3s API server
.Adding each agent(worker) node:
----
k3sup join --ip 10.110.3.0 --server-ip 10.110.2.10 --k3s-channel stable
----
